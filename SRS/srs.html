		<h3 id='1'>1. Introduction</h3>
		<h4 id='1.1'>1.1 Purpose</h4>
		<p>
			This document serves the purpose of providing a comprehensive overview of our software, 'Find My Gadget'. This
			includes describing the user interface, system's primary uses and software requirements, which will aid developers
			with a clarified understanding of our software architecture and implementations.
		</p>

		<h4 id='1.2'>1.2 Document Conventions</h4>
		<p>
			Every requirement statement is assumed to have its own priority. Bold texts are used to emphasize section
			and sub-section headings, and highlighted words are arranged in the glossary.
		</p>


		<h4  id='1.3'>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions </h4>
		<p>This document is prepared in a sequential order and is intended for software developers and designers, project managers,
			testers, as well as any individual user who needs to understand the basic system architecture and its specifications. </p>


		<h4  id='1.4'>1.4 Product Scope</h4>
		<p>'Find My Gadget' is an online market-based product comparator that scraps electronic gadget models and provides optimized
			purchase solution for all the users and also generates a notion for trending gadgets to help its users reach out to trending
			products.</p>

		<p>It is considered that the users are located in Bangladesh, and the features of the system are designed to be more
			appropriate to Bangladeshi netizens.</p>

	<!-- Overall Description -->

	<div class="new_page">
		<h3 id='2'>2. Overall Perspective</h3>
		<h4 id='2.1'>2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
		<p>	A distributed gadget database system stores the following information. </p>
			<p>• To create a web scraper to crawl through and extract data relating to gadgets from websites.</p>
			<p>• To log the findings in a database for further manipulation.</p>
			<p>• To develop a web application to use as a front end and allow the user to operate the web scraper through an intuitive interface.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The deliverables for this project are:</p>
			<p>• Web scraper</p>
			<p>• Database</p>
			<p>• Web application</p>
			<p>• Android App</p>
		<h4 id='2.2'>2.2 Product Functions</h4>
		<p>The major functions of the product are –
			<ul>
				<li>Shows user some of the trending gadgets.</li>
				<li>Allows the user search for gadgets, existing in different websites.</li>
				<li>Depending on the searching criteria, it shows a list of product.</li>
				<li>Users can search using voice command and image search.</li>
			</ul>
		Here is a simple workflow diagram that shows some of the function and workflow:
		<div class="row">
			  <div class="column">
				<p><img src="img/workflow.png" alt="workflow_img"  style="width:100%" > </p>
			  </div>
		</div>
		</p>
		<h4 id='2.3'>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
		<p>User classes are:
			<ol>
				<li>Customer:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Customers will mostly use the web appliciation to get there desired gadgetgadget depending on there particular criteria available for them or see trending gadgets.
						The customers are not expected to be of very technical knowledge and thus the user interface will be made very simple and an easy to understand structure.No educational
						or technical expertise needed at all.</li>
					</ul><br>
				</li>
				<li>Administrator:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The administrator should have a college degree and experience in data base management system.They should know how to handle database,have the ability to update the
						informations in the database and manage it accordingly.</li>
					</ul><br>
				</li>
				<li>Developer:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The developers are expected to have high knowledge about software developing and designing.They have to privilege to update and add new features of the app for
						further enhancement of user interface.</li>
					</ul><br>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h4 id='2.4'>2.4 Operating Environment</h4>
		<p>
			The software will have two platforms in which it will work, one is the website platform and the other is the android app platform.Distributed database in necessary.Datbase
			configuration is google firebase.n website platform it will be running with the combination of Python,Django,SQL. And on the android platform it will be running with the
			use of Java, PHP and Sql.
		</p><br>
		<h4 id='2.5'>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
		<p>As this is a web scrapping basd online application so it mainly dependent on the websites access and there response.If for some reason the websites are down, we wont be able
		to update our database.Also,The data that has been extracted will first need to be treated so that they can be easily understood. In certain cases, this might take a long time
		and a lot of energy to complete.	
		</p><br>
		<h4 id='2.6'>2.6 User Documentation</h4>
		<p>The system is designed to be intuitive and user friendly. But if there are further queries, the user can go
			through the user manual and online video tutorials.</p>
		<h4 id='2.7'>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
			<p>It is assumed that the software will work fine as long it is used on an android device or on a web browser.</p>
			<p>As the software is dependent on scrapping other websites, so as long as other websites are working fine also the backend of the website are unchanged.</p>

	<!-- Interfaces -->

	<div class="new_page">

		<h3 id='3'>3. External Interface Requirements</h3>

		<h4 id='3.1'>3.1 User Interfaces</h4>

		<p>When the user search www.gmg.com the user will see an log in page. if the user doesn’t have an account then the actor 
		can simply press the create account option. System will response by giving a registration page. The actor provides Name, Email, password,
		confirm password, phone number and address. By submitting this the information will be collected to 
		the server and system will take to the log in page. Actor can simply log in by giving email and password.
		After logged in an actor can view a few the tending products on the home page. actor can search any product 
		which he wants to view with the best saving price and best offered. The system will fetch these searched products
		information from various websites and comparing between passed products, the system will show the best saving products 
		on the screen. <br> The actor can view these products with prices, reviews, vendor and the saving that the actor will make
		from this from other available websites products. Actor can select any of these by comparing the reviews, prices and other stuffs. 
		Then this will redirect the actor to the actual webpages on where the actor can view all other details about this product and can
		buy if the actor wishes to buy this product by competing that web sites criteria. An actor can also view other tends by clicking 
		this from the home pages. All of this stuff will show the name of the product, images, reviews, vendor and the saving percentage 
		that the actor can make from this website. The actor can also choose from these viewed products and can buy the actors preferred product.
		An actor can also search products by images and continue the tasks. After completing all the tasks, the user can log out from this server.
		This will work from both web version and mobile application. On both version this will work same. </p>

		<h4 id='3.2'>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
		<p>As this is about web version and mobile application. Neither the mobile application nor the web version has any special hardware requirements.
		So, the system will not have any hardware interface.<br>
		Since the application must run over the internet, all the hardware shall require to connect internet will be hardware 
		interface for the system. As for e.g. Modem, WAN – LAN, Ethernet Cross-Cable and the desired design constraints should meet 
		into the functionality of hardware and software.  </p>

		<h4  id='3.3'>3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>

		<p>This software is web version and mobile application based. both of this version has to run from a web server and initial loading time depends on the internet speed which also depends on the device from which the product is run.
		<br>The android version of the mobile should be above version 6 and the browser should support at least 80% of HTML5. 
		The web development tools should conform either IBM's CUA standards or Microsoft's GUI standards.
		There is no memory requirement from user end of this application..
		</p>


		<h4 id='3.4'>3.4 Communications Interfaces</h4>

		<p>There are many types of interfaces as such supported by the E-Store software system namely; User Interface, Software Interface and Hardware Interface.
		The protocol used shall be HTTP for the intranet communication will be through TCP/IP protocol suite.
		The Port number used will be 80.
		There shall be logical address of the system in IPv4 format. </p>
